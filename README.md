# Actions SemVer Checker Action

Every time you publish a new version of a GitHub Action, say `v1.2.3`, it's customary to also update the tags for `v1.2` and `v1` to point to the same commit. That way people can subscribe to  either an exact version or a floating version that's automatically updated when the action's author pushes a new version.

Unfortunately, GitHub's creative use of tags doesn't do this automatically and many actions don't auto-update their major and minor versions whenever they release a new  patch.

You can run this action for your GitHub Action's repository to ensure the correct tags have been created and point to the correct commits.

Example output:

```
WARNING: Ambiguous version: v1 - Exists as both tag (f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744) and branch (f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744)
ERROR: Version: v1.0.0 does not exist and must match: v1 ref f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744
```

# Usage

```yaml  
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  # Check out with fetch-depth: 0
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0

- uses: jessehouwing/actions-semver-checker@v1
  with:
    # Configures warnings for minor versions.
    # Default: true
    warn-minor-version: ''
```

[Example workflow](https://github.com/jessehouwing/actions-semver-checker/blob/main/.github/workflows/action-semver-checker.yml):

```yaml
name: Check SemVer

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  check-semver:
    concurrency:
      group: '${{ github.workflow }}'
      cancel-in-progress: true
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - uses: jessehouwing/actions-semver-checker@v1
        with:
          warn-minor-version: true
```
# Future updates

I expect to update this action to

 * automatically update the major and minor version when a new patch version is created.
 * generate the correct git commands to manually correct an existing action.
 * ensure proper github releases exist for each tag
 * ensure github release tags are signed
 * drop a sarif file so the task can generate security issues.
